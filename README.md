# lgi_learn
AI model to predict the local gyrification index for a vertex based on the mesh instead of computing it.


## About

Computing lGI for brain surface meshes is slow and sometimes fails even for good quality meshes, leading to exclusion of the respective MRI scans. This project aims to provide a trained model that will predict the lGI for a vertex based on the mesh neighborhood.

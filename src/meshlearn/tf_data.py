    # Idea for organization of traning data: leave the meshes in FreeSurfer format files
    # and read the coordinates of the *n_neigh* closest vertices (along mesh edges) from the files for each vertex (read using nibabel or trimesh, based
    # on the file extension maybe). 
    # The mesh k-ring neighborhood needs to be computed for this (with a k-value that yields at least n vertices),
    # which can be done with trimesh. Then compute the distance matrix for the neighborhood vertices and take the BN closest ones, and
    # get their coordinates. This local neighborhood (given by coordinates relative to the current vertex) represents the mesh structure
    # that we should learn the descriptor value from.
    # The descriptor value itself can be parsed from FreeSurfer curv files, or optionally from CSV files. Maybe we should support both.
    #
    # Thus, this data generator needs to open 2 separate files to obtain a full training data set: the mesh file and the mesh descriptor file. This
    # also means that when we train to predict different mesh descriptors for a mesh, we do not need to store the same mesh several times on disk.
